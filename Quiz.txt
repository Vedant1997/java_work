Java Quiz Class 8

Q1.For every......after compilation?
Ans:True

Q2.Can you .... below code?
Ans:An interface can never have a private variable as, interfaces are meant to be inherited ie.
all its members need to be utilixed by the inheriting class so,if you declare a variable private 
inside the interface you will restrict its scope of being used by the other classes.Hence having 
a private variable inside the interface is meaningless and hence shows error.

Q3.Can a ... one interface?
Ans:Yes

Q4.Why the below ... time error?
Ans:Because the scope of the methodX() in the class Y is not public.

Q5.How to ....code below?
Ans:We can access 'i' by writting "Q.i;" in the main.We can do this because an interface cannot create
its objects so,we can directly access its data members.

Q6.Can we use .... Block?
Ans:We cannot use abstract with a constructor.

Q7.Why final.....at a time?
Ans:Abstract keyword is used when we want to change the value of a given data member or override a 
member function whereas final keyword is used where we strictly do not want to change the value of
the data members or we do not want to overide the member fuctions.Since both final and abstract
are used for completely different and opposite purposes we cannot use both at the same time.

Q8.Can we instantiate ..... as abstract?
Ans:Yes we can declare a class abstarct without having a single abstract function.
